# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

## Objectives:

    In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

    - Initialize App Engine.

    - Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

    - Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

    - Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

## Steps:

1. Initialize App Engine using the gcloud command-line interface.

    - Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
        gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

    - Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

    - Navigate to the source directory:
        cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world


2. Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

    - Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.
        sudo apt-get update
    
    - Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.
        sudo apt-get install virtualenv

        If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.
        virtualenv -p python3 venv

    - Activate the virtual environment.
        source venv/bin/activate

    - Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
        pip install  -r requirements.txt

    - Run the application:
        python main.py
        
        Please ignore the warning if any.
    - In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.

3. Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

    - Navigate to the source directory:
        cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

    - Deploy your Hello World application.
        gcloud app deploy

        If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.

        This app deploy command uses the app.yaml file to identify project configuration.

    - Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
        gcloud app browse

    - Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.
